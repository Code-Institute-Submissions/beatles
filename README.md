# The Beatles

The idea of this project was to create a website that is made by The Beatles, where you can find out information about the individuals and The Band.

The user can look through the studio albums as well as book to see The Beatles live.

## UX & Features

I wanted to create a very clean, minimalistic website that would allow users to easily find out information about The Beatles and their work.

They can also book to see The Beatles by filling out the form and choosing a date on the Book Us Page.

This website enables anyone, fan or not, to:
* Find out information about the history of The Beatles and the members themselves
* Discover what studio albums were made by the band while showcasing their album artwork
* Search through more history of the albums through links to each individual wiki page
* Listen to their music and watch their music videos via the Media page
* Follow The Beatles more closely by providing links to their social media (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram)
* Book to see the Beatles live by filling out the forms on the Book Us page

This website does all this in one easily accessabile place. 

There is no visual clutter to ensure that the user can access all the information they need in a clear, concise way.


## Technologies Used

[**JQuery**](https://jquery.com/)

The project uses JQuery for NavBarDropdown which is apllied on smaller devices.


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
